# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project.

## Prototype

This prototype contains a Camera preview which will be used to find objects.
Objects will be extracted with Google ML Kit Object Detection. From her they will be classified. 
Classification will be performed by Google AutoML Kit which was trained on a custom made dataset of firearms.
When objects are found they will be painted and labelled with the corresponding weapon such as "AK-74"
